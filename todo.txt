 - more password validation options
 - functionality is there to instantiate and validate fields without forms... better apis for it - move `FormValidator.createField` out of the FormValidator class
 - more customizable field error messages
 - handle form submission & form disabling while submitting? or is that not in scope of validation?
 - framework integration? (could be a pain)
 - override more default form control attributes? (i think not... might cause issues, and semantics might be weird). though would work well with Umbraco forms, etc...
